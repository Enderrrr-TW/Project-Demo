# Project Demo
This repo shows my previous works, including: 
- Quantifying the duration of typhoon-induced suspeneded sediment.
  - satellite imagery, multispectral imagery
- Plot Level LiDAR features extraction
  - LiDAR, vector processing
- Gravel imbrication clustering
  - LiDAR, depth first search (DFS)
- Leaf area index estimation with PointNet++
  - LiDAR, PointNet++, stratified cross validation

Note:
1. Some of my works have not been published. The codes for those projects are not shared.
2. All of my previous projects using hyperspectral images are protected by NDA, and thus they cannot be found here.
