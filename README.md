# Project Demo
This repository showcases some of my previous projects, including:
- Quantifying the duration of typhoon-induced suspended sediment using multispectral imagery collected by a geostationary satellite
  - satellite imagery, multispectral imagery
- Extracting plot-level LiDAR features using various techniques.
  - LiDAR, vector processing
- Clustering gravel imbrication on the riverbed
  - LiDAR, depth first search (DFS)
- Estimating leaf area index using PointNet++ with stratified cross validation
  - LiDAR, PointNet++, stratified cross validation

Please note:
1. Some of my projects have not yet been published, and the associated code is not shared in this repository.
2. Due to non-disclosure agreements, my previous projects using hyperspectral imagery are not available in this repository.
