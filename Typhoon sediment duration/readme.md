This work was published on Remote Sensing (https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/2/194).
I was responsible for developing all the codes used in this paper.

The purpose of this work is to estimate the duration of typhoon-induced suspended sediment. Since the heavy cloud still existed after the typhoon passed, it is difficult to find imagery that capture the wide range of the ocean surface. Therefore, we use imagery collected by a geostationary satellite, which provides 8 imagery everyday. We hope this approach can help ecology research. Creature living in the ocean, such as coral, may be impacted by suspended sediment.
