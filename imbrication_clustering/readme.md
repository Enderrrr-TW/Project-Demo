This project consists of two stages. In the first stage, we employed deep learning techniques to perform gravel segmentation on point clouds in order to separate individual gravels. Further details will be provided once this work is published.

In the second stage of this project, I was responsible for using DFS (depth-first search) and certain conditions to cluster the imbrication.

Examining the details of one imbrication, with the a-axis and b-axis also depicted.

The characteristics of the individual gravels were also determined.
